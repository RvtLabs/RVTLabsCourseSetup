## The World of Robotics

From smart factories to exploring Mars, robots are transforming our world. But what exactly makes a robot "smart"? Let's break it down.

### What is a Robot?
At its core, a robot is an intelligent machine that combines three key capabilities:

- 👀 **Sense its environment** - Using cameras, LiDAR, GPS, and positioning sensors
- 🧠 **Make decisions** - Processing information to choose the best action
- 🦾 **Take actions automatically** - Moving, manipulating, or responding to situations

Think of it like a human: we see (sense), think (decide), and act - robots do the same, just in their own unique way!

## Why Choose Robotics?
- � **Industry Growth** - Robotics market expanding at 25% annually
- 💡 **Innovation Leader** - At the forefront of technological advancement
